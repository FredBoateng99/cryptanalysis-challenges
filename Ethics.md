# Ethics & Responsible Disclosure

This project — Cryptanalysis Challenge — is intended for educational use only. The authors commit to the following principles:

1. **Scope**: All work is performed on lab-owned or explicitly permissioned targets. No unauthorized testing, scanning, or exploitation of third-party systems.
2. **Responsible Disclosure**: If vulnerabilities are discovered in third-party systems during authorized work, I will follow coordinated disclosure procedures and avoid public disclosure until responsibly handled.
3. **Data Handling**: No storage or sharing of sensitive user data. Any sample or leaked data used in this project is synthetically generated or permitted by the owner.
4. **Safety**: No production services will be disrupted. Exploit demonstrations use isolated, local test environments.
5. **Academic Integrity**: Proper citations will be included for borrowed code, algorithms, and references.
